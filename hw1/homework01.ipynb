    "You should make sure any code that you write to answer the questions is included in this notebook. You are **required** to go to the Kernel option and choose **\"Restart & Run All\"** before submission. Double check that your entire notebook runs correctly and generates the expected output. Finally, make sure to save your work (timestamp at the top tells you the last checkpoint and whether there are unsaved changes).
