The problem has many variants which are used for classification in machine learning and collaborative filtering in recommender systems. In this part you will code a few variants using `numpy`.\n",

Each row corresponds to a point, the first column (column index 0) contains the x-value, and the second column (column index 1) contains the y-value. Similarly, the code generates a random query point as a one-dimensional `numpy` array `query` of length two, where the first value is the x-value and the second is the y-value. This data is visualized in a scatter plot where `points` are represented as smaller blue dots and `query` is represented as a larger orange dot.\n",
